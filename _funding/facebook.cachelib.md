CORGi is part of the [Parallel Data Lab](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu)'s
ongoing collaboration with Facebook's CacheLib team on improving the
latency, efficiency, and cost of cache at datacenter-scale. Our
OSDI'20 paper introduced and characterized the CacheLib system, which
was developed and widely deployed at Facebook to aggregate caching
optimizations in a single system. We are now actively working with
other PDLers and Facebook on caching systems that improve cache
latency, efficiency, and cost even further. These projects are being
prototyped and tested within CacheLib. More information can be found
on the [PDL caching page](https://www.pdl.cmu.edu/CILES/index.shtml).
