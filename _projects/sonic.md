This project aims to enable a new class of intelligent, energy-harvesting computers. Future IoT applications will demand intelligence at the edge, and battery-less systems that harvest ambient energy from their environment are a promising technology. But energy-harvesting devices introduce new problems, since their intermittent power means that the devices suffer frequent power failures, where forward progress is lost. We are exploring the limits of these devices, developing novel software and hardware techniques to enable ubiquitous machine learning on energy-harvesting systems.
