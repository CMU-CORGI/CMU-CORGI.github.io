Caches are pervasive in computer systems and often determine an applications' end-to-end performance.
Yet caching theory often makes unrealistic assumptions,
forcing caching systems to rely upon best-effort heuristics that perform poorly and break easily.

In this project, we are designing and implementing theoretically-grounded caching systems.
These systems raise a wide range of questions in the fundamental theory as well as practical aspects of caches.
Many of the resulting techniques are applicable across the system stack,
from processor caches of a few MBs to datacenter caches with hundreds of PBs.
