Caches are pervasive in computer systems and often determine an applications' end-to-end performance.
Yet since caching theory often makes unrealistic assumptions,
most caching systems rely upon heuristics that perform poorly and break easily.
We are interested in building theoretically-grounded caching systems,
and are thus exploring a wide range of questions in the fundamental theory as well as practical aspects of caches.
Many of the resulting policies are applicable across the system stack,
from processor caches of a few MBs to datacenter caches with hundreds of PBs.
